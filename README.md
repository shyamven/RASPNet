## RASPNet: Adaptive Radar Processing Code Examples
This repository provides code examples for adaptive radar processing tasks using the RASPNet dataset. Additional updates and changes made to RASPNet are posted here.

## Dataset
The RASPNet dataset can be downloaded from the following [link](https://duke.is/8/jvkg). The dataset includes feature-label pairs for training and evaluating the code examples. These pairs are stored in the **EXAMPLES/** folder within the base directory of this repository.

## Code Examples
The code examples are categorized into two folders:

- Localization_Examples: This folder contains code for tasks related to target localization within radar data.
- Transfer_Learning_Examples: This folder demonstrates using pre-trained models for other radar processing tasks through transfer learning techniques.

## RASPNet Dataset Updates
This section will be updated to reflect any changes or additions made to the RASPNet dataset. Please check back for future updates.

## Getting Started
To get started using the code examples, follow these steps:
- Download the RASPNet dataset from the provided link.
- Extract the downloaded dataset and place the files from the **EXAMPLES/** folder within the base directory of this repository.
- Refer to the individual example files for specific instructions on running the code.
