## RASPNet: Adaptive Radar Processing Code Examples
This repository provides code examples for adaptive radar processing tasks through the RASPNet EXAMPLES and CVNN datasets â€” processed versions of RASPNet, used to produce the empirical results from the main text.

## Datasets
The RASPNet EXAMPLES and CVNN datasets to run the code examples can be downloaded from the following [link](https://www.sdms.afrl.af.mil/index.php?collection=raspnet). These datasets includes feature-label pairs for training and evaluating the models in the code examples, and span five radar scenarios: $i \in \\{29,35,60,62,76 \\}$.

## Code Examples
The code examples are categorized into two folders:

- **Localization_Examples/**: This folder contains code for tasks related to radar target localization.
- **Transfer_Learning_Examples/**: This folder demonstrates using pre-trained models for radar target localization through transfer learning.

## Getting Started
To get started using the code examples, follow these steps:
- Download the RASPNet datasets from the provided link for the five radar scenarios, $i \in \\{29,35,60,62,76 \\}$.
- Extract the downloaded dataset and place the files within the same directory as the code examples from **Localization_Examples/** and **Transfer_Learning_Examples/**.
- Refer to the individual code example files for specific instructions on running the code.
