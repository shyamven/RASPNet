## RASPNet: Adaptive Radar Processing Code Examples
This repository provides code examples for adaptive radar processing tasks using the RASPNet dataset found in the main text, and hosts the RASPNet website.
The RASPNet website can be accessed via the following [link](https://shyamven.github.io/RASPNet/).

## Dataset
The RASPNet example dataset to run the code examples can be downloaded from the following [link]([https://duke.is/8/jvkg](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=b01166a6-0526-454a-aaff-943c7fada5d4&origin_path=%2FEXAMPLES%2F)). The dataset includes feature-label pairs for training and evaluating the code examples. These pairs are stored in the **EXAMPLES/** folder within the base directory of this repository.

## Code Examples
The code examples are categorized into two folders:

- **Localization_Examples/**: This folder contains code for tasks related to target localization within radar data.
- **Transfer_Learning_Examples/**: This folder demonstrates using pre-trained models for other radar processing tasks through transfer learning techniques.

## RASPNet Dataset Updates
This section will be updated to reflect any changes or additions made to the RASPNet dataset. Please check back for future updates.

## Getting Started
To get started using the code examples, follow these steps:
- Download the RASPNet dataset from the provided link.
- Extract the downloaded dataset and place the files from the **EXAMPLES/** folder within the base directory of this repository.
- Refer to the individual example files for specific instructions on running the code.
