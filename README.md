## RASPNet: Adaptive Radar Processing Code Examples
This repository provides code examples for adaptive radar processing tasks through the RASPNet EXAMPLES dataset â€” a processed version of RASPNet, used to produce the empirical results from the main text. It also hosts the RASPNet webpage, which can be accessed via this [link](https://shyamven.github.io/RASPNet/).

## EXAMPLES Dataset
The RASPNet EXAMPLES dataset to run the code examples can be downloaded from the following [link](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=b01166a6-0526-454a-aaff-943c7fada5d4&origin_path=%2FEXAMPLES%2F). The dataset includes feature-label pairs for training and evaluating the code examples, and spans five radar scenarios: $i \in \\{29,35,60,62,76 \\}$. These pairs are stored in the **EXAMPLES/** folder within the base directory of RASPNet.

## Code Examples
The code examples are categorized into two folders:

- **Localization_Examples/**: This folder contains code for tasks related to radar target localization.
- **Transfer_Learning_Examples/**: This folder demonstrates using pre-trained models for radar target localization through transfer learning.

## Getting Started
To get started using the code examples, follow these steps:
- Download the RASPNet EXAMPLES dataset from the provided link for the five radar scenarios, $i \in \\{29,35,60,62,76 \\}$.
- Extract the downloaded dataset and place the files within the same directory as the code examples from **Localization_Examples/** and **Transfer_Learning_Examples/**.
- Refer to the individual code example files for specific instructions on running the code.
